# opim-contact-export
Simplet script to export contacts from the database software OPIM


I use SHR on smart phone OpenMoko Neo Frerunner.
SHR use OPIM as telephone layer.
OPIM has contacts stored in SQLite.

This script connect directly to an SQLite database and exports phone contacts.
Exported is in VCF format.
